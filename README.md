# RB5-University-Relations
A repository for files that are useful for the Qualcomm University relations kit that is based on the RB5 robotics board
This readme will heighlight the use of some files:

### RB5-bracket.STL
This is a 3d-model that is able to be printed so that the RB5 board can be attached to the mBot base. The bracket is attached to the mBot with spare screws from the kit but for the board itself 4-6 M2.5 screws need to be found somewhere yourself.

### pic.launch.xml
A launch file for the [gscam](https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam) ROS2 package, specifically written for the RB5 drivers.

### photo_node.py
